In this screenshoot you can see two army: red controlled by AI and blue controlled by player.
Each player warriors position are used to compute influence map and decide where AI have to move units.

## Status

In progress, just a basic framework for now.
Ai feature right now:
* establish target
* move to it
* attack when in range
* influence map

## Vision

Wargame is a simple single player vs ai game. 
You control various type of pieces and must attack to win :)
